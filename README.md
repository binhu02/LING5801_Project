# LING5801_Project

Hi there, here is my code for my project in LING 5801, 2023 Spring at UMN.



Train the model with main.ipynb. Save the model and evaluate it in evaluation.ipynb.

Generated texts are available in generated_no_title.tsv and generated_given_title.tsv.



The saved model weight after training in the latest code is availabel here (on Google Drive, UMN Google account required):
