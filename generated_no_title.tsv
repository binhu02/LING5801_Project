Research into a way to prevent or mitigate this effect is underway, but no permanent containment has been proposed. SCP-4861 is currently surrounded by a high-intensity electromagnetic field, which is to be maintained at a constant temperature of 50 K.
Description: SCP-4861 is a small area located approximately 120km east of the village of Barents.1 The area was recently discovered by Foundation satellites and had been marked on all maps, but no indication was ever given of the location being a village. There is no evidence of any population at this point and the only indication of recent population was a single human skeletal remains found on the eastern side of the mountain. SCP-4861 has no population history; no records of it having existed prior to 1948, nor have any records of it being inhabited.
This area is surrounded by a high-intensity electromagnetic field which is to be maintained at a constant temperature of 50 K. This field is active when an active source of electromagnetic radiation is present at a location within SCP-4861. The radiation is emitted via gamma rays from various objects or materials in the area, resulting in increased radio and television broadcast and internet traffic. This electromagnetic radiation is a result of the anomalous properties of the area. Radiation produced by SCP-4861 is primarily concentrated in the radiation source, primarily gamma rays, and not by the radiation produced by the object or material itself. The energy of the radiation is converted into an energy equivalent to the energy of an object, in this case an object that can contain up to 12 x 106 MeV of gamma	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

The object is the designation for a piece of clothing that was worn by an individual during a recent event. The person was observed by several witnesses to have "made an impact" on the object, as it apparently felt a certain way, which is how it is currently classified. A person with this designation wears the item, but it was never directly damaged. It is also theorized that the person could not make any direct impact on the object as it had a very high impact factor. The person had to make a much higher impact factor, though, to make it break even.

Description: SCP-1396 is an elderly man with a bald, gray beard. SCP-1396 appears to be a middle-aged Caucasian male in his forties.
SCP-1396 is constantly juggling the object at his hand and attempts to balance himself by shifting it back and forth. However, this is not a realistic balance and results in the person who did this being unable to maintain their balance. This phenomenon seems to be tied to the fact that SCP-1396 wears a heavy, red hat with a white ribbon and is often seen sitting on a sofa in the corner of the room.
The person who performed this juggling action would sometimes, while in a relaxed state, have a noticeable amount of difficulty with a balance to maintain a consistent hand position. This would become more pronounced if the person held their right hand and was unable to keep their left hand steady.
When a person is completely unable to maintain balance for at least 10 minutes, and after that, is unable to maintain an accurate hand position in any direction, a new subject will manifest in front of the subject. The subject is completely aware of the object in front of them and will begin to mimic that action until the subject's hand and hand balance is restored to a point where the person is able to maintain an accurate hand position and hold an object in the opposite direction from where the subject's hand had been.

When a living human remains in SCP-2664's vicinity, it will slowly become animated and active until it reaches approximately 70% of the way. Once this occurs, a group of humanoid figures will emerge from the grave and begin to perform all manner of human activity. These actions often take the form of human or animal actions and are performed with no apparent attempt to stop or disengage. The individual is not aware of their own actions, and will continually repeat the same actions. If the individual continues to perform the action it is performing, it will become active again.
This does not appear to be a permanent phenomenon, as the individual will continue doing it until it reaches a point where it is no longer active. Once active, it will move and return to the ground.

All previous staff members who were involved in creating or performing tests on any item listed in this file have been removed from their position and reassigned to other jobs.
SCP-2434 is a phenomenon that affects a single item of paleoart. The item in question is an abstract painting. When an individual views this painting, they are not aware of its anomalous nature. The individual may then view this same painting again, and it will always appear to be the original painting. The individual has no desire to purchase the item. Subjects will often look away from the item after viewing it, and will find it physically difficult to reach for it. Subjects will often look away from the object for the duration of the viewing period. Subjects will often continue viewing the item for more than one minute. If any item of paleo art is displayed for a prolonged amount of time, subjects will experience a similar phenomenon.
The nature of this effect can be described in a couple of ways. If an individual views a piece of paleo art for a period of approximately thirty minutes or more, the subject will eventually look away from the item and will then look back at it.

Description: SCP-2784 is a humanoid head partially composed of frozen human skull. It is covered in an intricate pattern of filigree, in which the bones of various animals have been carved. The head has been observed to retain the ability to move, allowing it to move freely within the skull.
When SCP-2784 is not being examined, it remains motionless and will move in the direction of the viewer. The viewer is then to continue the view and can no longer see anything that the viewer is unable to see. If the viewer remains motionless and moves, it is able to regain the ability to see anything that the viewer has not seen before. If the viewer is able to see anything, it will continue the view to an infinite distance.
SCP-2784 is constantly motionless, and can no longer perceive anything. The viewer will constantly shift his/her location, and the viewer is never able to move to another point in the skull. The viewer's body will appear to shift, and it is believed that this occurs when the viewer is within the skull. The viewer also has the ability to move around the skull, however this is not possible.
If the viewer is to become motionless and motion within the skull, it is only possible to move in the direction the viewer is going, and the viewer cannot be moved within the skull. The viewer's body will not continue to shift. This phenomenon does not occur if the viewer is within the skull.	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

Description: SCP-3715 is an anomalous phenomenon that affected the government of Uzbekistan. SCP-3715 has been identified as a memetic event that occurred within the Uzbek government.
The exact extent of the government of Uzbekistan affected by SCP-3715 was not fully understood. The most common estimate is that more than 7,000 million Uzbek citizens were affected, and that approximately 50% of all Uzbek citizens are believed to be affected. Additionally, at least 40% of all Uzbek government officials are affected, and that approximately 15% of all Uzbek government employees are affected.
Following the events of 12/11/1985, the government of Uzbekistan was heavily affected. It was confirmed that the government of Uzbekistan is capable of possessing and creating an entity that is capable of manipulating both physical and digital reality. SCP-3715 is currently unknown, as it has not yet been shown to have affected the human government of Uzbekistan.
Addendum: This document was compiled from several investigations into a memetic anomaly that affected the government of Uzbekistan.
1. The government of Uzbekistan is aware of the nature of SCP-3715. A Memetic Event that affected the Uzbek government has not yet been seen.

Title:Polarization, the Unseelie
"Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: The polar regions in which SCP-6827 exists are to be observed from a distance of no greater than 3,000 meters. The following procedures have been devised to facilitate the detection and monitoring of the anomaly:
When SCP-6827 is observed from an object in a polar region, Foundation researchers are to follow the anomaly and document any discrepancies as soon as possible. Foundation agents are to be permanently embedded in local government officials to prevent the appearance of polar anomalies in their areas of responsibility.
Description: SCP-6827 is a phenomenon which occurs when any object or phenomenon within a polar region appears to be warped or distorted. Affected objects and phenomena will exhibit the effects of anomalous alteration when they move into a polar region. The exact degree of alteration can vary according to the size of the area affected. Any affected object or phenomenon will then undergo "plasmic ablation", as the object or phenomenon is reduced to its constituent atoms, allowing them to remain in the polar region.
The most notable example of this effect occurs when an object is placed within a polar region and is directly exposed to a polar effect. This event is known to cause an anomaly in the object; the object does not appear to change its shape or its dimensions, but instead, it becomes slightly warped and then is reduced to its constituent atoms.
This effect can only be performed on an object or phenomenon which is directly exposed to an effect which alters the object or phenomenon. The object or phenomenon will not change shape or dimensions as a result of the alteration; all of its existing properties will remain unchanged.

In the event of SCP-1547-3 being exposed to its current subject, all affected subjects are to be terminated on a case-by-case basis. Any instances of SCP-1547-4 are to be incinerated and destroyed using standard incineration methods.
Description: SCP-1547 is a collective designation for a collection of anomalous objects of various sizes. SCP-1547's anomalous properties do not manifest upon any individual or objects, but upon a larger quantity of their combined mass. Any individual who enters SCP-1547's active state will experience a mild discomfort during the next five (5) hours. The individual will then experience a period of several minutes during which all of their body tissues are injured. The subject will then experience a sudden feeling of "happiness", which will continue for an indeterminate amount of time until the subject dies. If an individual dies, all bodily tissues of their body will be injured for a period of approximately two days, and will then begin to regenerate.
