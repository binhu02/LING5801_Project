Description: SCP-2352 is a small, dilapidated farmhouse located in the small village of ██████████, Missouri. On the right side of the property is a large, dilapidated barn. This has been boarded up, however a door with no door leading outside has been left open. The only evidence of its existence is a small, crudely painted sign next to the door.
SCP-2352 is capable of communicating with human speech, however if one enters the room, it will not begin any conversation, but instead will begin a series of nonsensical, often nonsensical, sentences. This will often lead to the phrase 'I'm not a bad person', followed by what appears to be a blank, unreadable image of what appears to be a large, heavily-trailed train. Occasionally, this train will approach a house and the door will open.
SCP-2352's anomalous properties begin to manifest if the subject, or a subject, is in the room of SCP-2352 and takes any action on the subject, such as moving, running, or talking. If a subject takes any action on the subject, the words on the subject's face will begin to turn blue.

When an instance of SCP-2281 speaks in a certain language, it will attempt to communicate in a way that will not make sense to the listener. When this happens, it will often use the phrase "I don't understand what you're saying", and will often attempt to manipulate the meaning of the language in question.
SCP-2281 will often attempt to use any method that will cause any and all languages it encounters to have an "unnatural meaning". It has also been recorded that it will often use phrases and concepts that seem to contradict itself.
It is theorized that if an instance of SCP-2281 attempts to communicate in a language other than English, it will attempt to speak in a way that would not make sense to the speaker, thus creating this effect. The exact method used by SCP-2281 is currently unknown, and it is theorized that it could communicate in any language other than English.

SCP-1664 will, whenever it is given the chance, enter an area where it is able to manipulate the minds of people, or specifically, to allow it to manipulate the minds of humans. This method of manipulation appears to be fairly advanced, as it is able to manipulate people with very little effort or effort.
This ability is limited to the manipulation of people with Level-3 or higher knowledge and has only been observed when being used on those with Level-2 and above skills. The reason why these individuals were able to manipulate the minds of others has yet to be discovered.

SCP-3909 appears to have a mild mental abnormality. The first anomalous properties of SCP-3909 were discovered when it was believed to be able to speak, despite the fact that it did not have eyes. While this is not a requirement for the anomalous qualities of SCP-3909, it is still a limitation of its anomalous nature. The anomalous qualities of SCP-3909 appear to be limited to its appearance. However, the anomaly itself also has a number of other anomalies. SCP-3909 has been observed to have other abilities, including a small but capable hand.
A sample of SCP-3909 is available here.

Special Containment Procedures: The house containing SCP-4082 has been condemned to prevent access to SCP-4082 by unauthorized individuals. The land surrounding SCP-4082 has been purchased by the Foundation and designated Site-4082-A. A perimeter fence has been set up around the property and designated as Foundation-owned private land.
Description: SCP-4082 is the collective designation given to the town of Clearfield, Oklahoma, with the most notable properties of being the house in question, SCP-4082-1.
SCP-4082-1 contains a number of anomalous properties. The majority of these properties are listed below, but as with previous instances, SCP-4082-1 is also an instance of SCP-4082. The following properties may or may not be linked to each other.
If you look at the above list, you will notice that several properties are associated with SCP-4082.
Any one of the properties listed above can be linked to any other property by simply removing their names. However, it is important to note that the property with the second property is not necessarily connected. For instance, the building with the third property is not necessarily connected to the building with the fourth property. These properties are also not always connected.
The following properties are associated with SCP-4082.
When a property is linked to a property, the property will be affected by SCP-4082 and become unconnected, and any unconnected properties will be affected by SCP-4082 and become connected. The link will not always be	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

Following Incident 1152-1, the existence of SCP-1162 has been established to be a fiction.
Description: SCP-1162 refers to a group of individuals who were initially present in a village in the village of Vossen, a town of 1.5km2 in south eastern Sweden, but which became a reality due to a minor malfunction at the local health department.
The Foundation had been searching for the exact reason behind the anomaly, and in search of evidence, it was discovered that there was a missing person in the village named Ovis. The town has since been officially cordoned off.
When a person comes in contact with a body part in a random place, such as the front door or a window or another person's shoulder, they will receive a message that states:
Hey, I found you, it's Ovis. Here's a few things you may not know about me:
I don't want to be that person. I won't get close to it anymore.
I'm not that person, it's Ovis. He's going to be with me forever.
So… uh… thanks, I guess.
The message is delivered with the tone of a warning from the local health department, which will then proceed to call an official to explain to the person to their next location in the future. The message is then deleted, but only after the person has passed their next location.
The message, after being deleted, is then re-submitted with the person's last location in the future.

"Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of SCP-5786, all containment procedures are to be focused on containment, and are not to be adapted to the current reality.
Research of the origins of SCP-5786 and related anomalous phenomena must continue, and should be carried out as much as it is possible within the limits of available resources, and be carried out in a timely manner. In the case of a failure to achieve all of these goals, the current containment procedures are to be revised to fit the reality and to provide further resources to ensure that SCP-5786 will not be successfully brought to pass.
The existence of SCP-5786, and related phenomena, has been previously unknown by Foundation-operated satellite imagery surveillance. The existence of SCP-5786 is now classified as an unknown anomaly.
SCP-5786's designation is restricted to two persons at any given time, and is not to be used for anything other than strictly research purposes.
No further containment is to be carried out.
SCP-5786 is to be kept in a Standard Containment Cell at Site-81's Site-19 Research Wing. Research staff are allowed to interact with SCP-5786 on a case-by-case basis.
For research staff to use SCP-5786, they are to have a minimum of Level 2 clearance. Research staff with Level 3 clearance are not allowed to use SCP-5786 for research purposes.
If a subject with Level 3 clearance is not able to use SCP-5786 for research, or if it cannot be used for research due to low Level 4 clearance, their assigned researcher is to be removed from the project.

Description: SCP-6546 is a partially collapsed mass of concrete measuring roughly 9m in height and 2.7m in depth. SCP-6546 is surrounded by a large mass of concrete that has formed around a human ear, forming a mouth. SCP-6546's mouth is not a mouth, as the object is located outside the eye, but rather a narrow opening, accessible only through the mouth. The ear appears to be fully formed. The object resembles a large, black molar and the object is filled with mucus.
SCP-6546 has been recorded to have an extremely high temperature and a pressure of approximately 1.8 atmospheres. SCP-6546 also has a low volume, as the volume of its environment is far larger than the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide that would be required to provide the same amount of energy.
While the anomaly does not appear to suffer in any way from normal environmental conditions, it is capable of inducing a mild but disturbing level of pain in the object. SCP-6546 is capable of a form of telekinesis which can only be activated by force or with the use of the object itself. SCP-6546 can only be used to the extent that it cannot be physically touched or touched by a subject.

Individuals are capable of performing all actions in a manner that they deem fitting, and can be considered "passive" due to their lack of reaction. These individuals are usually unaware of the existence of the negative emotions they are feeling. It is likely that the individuals are unaware of their feelings. They are also likely unaware of their cognitive deficiencies and can still function normally without awareness of their limitations.
Individuals who are exposed to this phenomenon will usually not notice any physical changes. These individuals are unable to do any actions or engage in any activity that they do not want to. It is unclear whether they have any control over what they do and the effect is likely to affect them.
The affected individuals typically begin to feel anger, sadness, anger and boredom. In the end, however, this effect will eventually wear off	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-876 is kept in a sealed storage container in the Safe wing of Site-66. No personnel are to come in physical contact with the object without the express written approval of the site director or a Level 4 researcher. In order to ensure compliance with site management and ensure that the item is kept in its container, no personnel are allowed to touch the object more than 4 times in a 3 hour period. In order to ensure proper containment, no personnel are allowed to touch the object for longer than 5 minutes in a single 4 hour period.
Any personnel attempting to touch or manipulate the object for longer than 5 minutes without written approval will be suspended for a period of no more than 1 day, and then will be re-certified to a higher level of clearance.
Description: SCP-876 is a small silver-plated metal toy figurine of a young girl. On the bottom of the doll is written the word ‘The angry linguist’ and ‘Its job is to find all words in the dictionary’ written in white blood cells in a row. The object is very fragile and can easily break without even looking at it.
When a human hand touches the object, all of the blood cells in the hand will become angry, and will attempt to damage any object in its vicinity. This effect will continue for approximately 5 minutes and is cumulative, causing the victim to lose any and all skills which had previously been shown in their previous job. This effect only occurs when the object is touched by a human hand, or a human mouth, or any other type of hands of any kind.
If the subject is attacked, a large amount of blood cells will erupt from the subject's arm and	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

Item #: SCP-3526
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3526 is currently contained in a standard anomalous item locker.
Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-3526 are to be instructed in a simple, self-contained manner, to minimize the chance of exposure. A list of suggested methods is included below. The following procedures may not apply to individuals who are already under Foundation influence; do not attempt to follow this list.
1. A suitable computer can be found for the purpose of use with SCP-3526. This computer should be connected to an internet connection or to a local network, preferably via LAN. If the connection fails, contact the computer supervisor.
2. On the internet, use SCP-3526 to search the Internet for phrases like "awesome" or "better" or "better," and if a phrase appears to have an anomalous effect, press the 'e' key. In the same terminal as the internet connection, use the 'q' key to change the setting of a file for SCP-3526 to activate it.
3. Attempting to make any attempt to change the setting of SCP-3526 will result in the screen with the effect of an unidentifiable entity's voice (which is, presumably, from a high-powered microphone). If you attempt to remove this effect, the effect will be returned.
4. Experimentation with the 'e' key is prohibited, as is entering the password for SCP-3526.
5. When you are finished searching, do not press the 'e' key again. Instead, press the 'q' key.
6. If you attempt to access the 'e' key again, the effect of the entity (which is presumably a high-powered	This is an SCP-Foundation fiction:

The figure's face is obscured by an indistinct white mist and has the words “SILENCE!” written in white chalk on it.
Addendum 5111.1: Discovery
When the two were discovered they were walking in the dark, and in one case was a blackened face; in the other, the person's face was revealed and the words “MIGHTY DARK, RUSSIA!” were scrawled over the person. When an X-ray was taken of the face, it was clear that there were dark patches of red flesh in it, and both of them had been dead.
An investigation revealed that the two were at the same cave, and the corpse of the person was found in a cave somewhere in the country.
A second investigation revealed that the body had come in contact with the person's face, and that it was covered in blood.
It was then discovered that the person, “Mighty DARK, RUSSIA!�, was able to see through the
